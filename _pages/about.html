    <p>I'm a {% age %}-year-old student and web developer currently living in Münster, Germany. I grew up and went to school in the town of Reutlingen, Germany. After I finished my Abitur in 2011, I went to beautiful New Zealand for 5 months on a Working Holiday. After that, I started studying <a href="https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de" target="_new">Information Systems</a> at the University of Münster. Nowadays, I work as a Software Engineer at the Web Development and Consultancy company <a href="https://www.zweitag.de/de" target="_new">Zweitag</a>.</p>

    <p>I started programming computers early on and developed small Windows applications. After finding out about Linux, I focused on PHP web development. In 2006, I built a fan website for the now discontinued TV show GIGA. Later, I was part of the team that maintained our <a href="http://www.list-gymnasium.de" target="_new">school's website</a>.</p>

    <p>In the past few years I've been into what they call the 'Internet of Things' and tried to automate as much as my home as possible &ndash; without just buying pre-made stuff off the shelf but by teaching myself how to use microcontrollers and embedded computers to achieve this task. I hope to write some blog posts about what I built &ndash; maybe others could learn from my experiments and I could get ideas for my next pet project.</p>

    <p>Lately, I like developing web applications with the Ruby on Rails stack and with Javascript frontend frameworks such as Ember.js. I also explore the possibilities of server infrastructure automation and depend heavily on it for my home setup &ndash; I like having my power outlets and lights be connected to the Internet.

    <p>I am also writing my Bachelor's thesis on the topic of <a href="http://microservices.io">Microservices</a> with Ruby on Rails &ndash; if you have any insights in this area, I'd love you to contact me.</p>
